This screenshot demonstrates a functioning Mosquitto MQTT setup using MinGW64, where Terminal 1 is running the Mosquitto broker, Terminal 2 is actively subscribing to the topic "test/topic", and Terminal 3 is publishing messages ("Hello" and "testing") to the same topic, which are then received by the subscriber in Terminal 2.
